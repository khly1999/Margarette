<a name="Algebraic Expression"><h1>Algebraic Expression</h1></a>
<b>ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSION</b>,statement of the equality of two expressions formulated by applying to a set of variables the algebraic operations,
namely, addition, subraction, multiplication, division, raising to a power, and extraction of root. Examples are x<sup>2</sup>+ 1 and
(y<sup>4</sup>x<sup>2</sup>+2xy-y)(x-1)=12. An important special case of such equations is that of polynomial equations, expression of the form
axn + bxn<sup>-1</sup> + ... + gx + h = k. They have as many solutions as their degree(n), and the search for their solutions stimulated much of the development
of classical and modern algebra. Equations like x sin(x) = c that involve nonalgebraic operations, such as logarithms or trigonometric functions, are said to be transcendental.

<a name="Chemical Compound"><h1>Chemical Compound</h1></a>
A<b> Chemical Compound</b>,is a chemical substance consisting of two or more different chemically bonded chemical elements, with fixed ratio determining the coposition.

The Ratio of each element is usually expressed by chemical formula.

For example, water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is a compound consisting of two hydrogens atoms bonded to an oxygen atom.

The atoms within a compound can be held together by a variety of interactions, ranging from covalents bonds to electrostatic forces in ionic bonds.

A continuum of bond polarities exist between the purely covalent bond(as in H2) and ionic bonds.

For example H<sub>2</sub>O is held together by polar covalents bonds.

Sodium chloride is an example of ionic compound.
